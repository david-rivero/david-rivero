### About Me
Fullstack Developer based in Portugal, with 9 years of experience in the industry, working with technologies like React, Angular, Typescript and E2E / unit testing in Frontend, and Python and Node.js in the Backend side.

I worked for several companies and customers in Uruguay, and, in the last years, I decided to move to Europe to continue my professional growth in Software Engineering.
